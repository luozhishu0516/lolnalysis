League of Legends Analytics Project üéÆüìä

These past few weeks, I have been working on an analytics project focused on drawing insights from my League of Legends games. I enjoy playing ranked, but I am not always the best player. My goal with this project is to evaluate my performance, determine what I am doing well, and identify areas for improvement to increase my rank.

This project parses my past match history using the Riot API. Note that some aspects of the game‚Äîlike items purchased, decision-making, or teammates‚Äô performance‚Äîare not captured in my data.

You can follow along with my files in this repository.

Riot API Access üõ†Ô∏è

To collect match history, I applied for an API key and used the following APIs:

Summoner V4: Retrieve a player's puuid from their summoner name.

Match V5 ‚Äî puuid: Return a list of recent match IDs (up to 100).

Match V5 ‚Äî matches: Return detailed match information in JSON format.

ETL Script: Python üêç

The Python script extracts match data from Riot API, transforms it into a DataFrame, and loads it into MySQL Amazon RDS.

Power BI Dashboard üìä‚ú®

After extracting and loading my match data into MySQL, I used Power BI Desktop to create an interactive dashboard. This helps visualize performance metrics and make data-driven decisions to improve ranked play.
